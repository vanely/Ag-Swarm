# Agentic Software Development Swarm

## Overview

A cutting-edge multi-layered agentic software development framework that can compress 18 developer-days into 6 hours while maintaining enterprise-grade security and reliability. This system orchestrates AI agents in a collaborative swarm to autonomously plan, develop, test, and deploy software applications.

## Core Architecture

The system is built on three foundational pillars:

**Intelligent Model Orchestration**

- Leverages multiple LLMs (GPT-5, Claude Opus 4.1, Grok 4) with dynamic model switching

- Routes tasks to optimal models based on complexity and domain expertise

- Real-time performance monitoring per model per task type

**Specialized Agent Roles**

- Strategic Planning Agent for architecture and PRD generation

- Frontend and Backend Development Agents

- DevOps Integration Agent

- Security Validation Agent

- Quality Assurance Agent

- Project Coordination Agent

**Communication Architecture**

- Kafka-based message passing between agents

- Shared state management through vector databases

- Multiple coordination protocols for different workflows

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Operation**: Sustains 200+ minute autonomous development sessions

- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Zero-trust security model with comprehensive governance

- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-layered review process with specialized agent personas

- **Production Pipeline**: Complete workflow from requirements to deployment

- **Scalability**: Handles increasing project complexity with specialized extension agents
