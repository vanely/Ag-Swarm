# Agentic Software Development Swarm

A scalable, AI-powered software development system that utilizes a swarm of specialized agents to replace traditional software development teams.

## Overview

The Agentic Software Development Swarm is a cutting-edge system that leverages multiple AI agents working in coordination to handle all aspects of the software development lifecycle. From planning and design to implementation, testing, and deployment, this system can automate the entire software development process.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for frontend, backend, DevOps, security, QA, and coordination

- **Layered Communication**: Efficient message passing and state sharing between agents

- **Memory Systems**: Vector databases and knowledge bases for persistent context

- **Model Orchestration**: Support for multiple AI models (GPT, Claude, Grok)

- **Pipeline-Based Workflow**: Structured phases for planning, development, integration, and deployment

- **Extensible**: Easy to add new specialized agents for specific domains

## System Architecture

The system is built with a modular design that allows agents to work both independently and collaboratively:

- **Core Layer**: Handles orchestration, communication, memory, and security

- **Agent Layer**: Both core and specialized agents that perform specific roles

- **Model Layer**: AI model clients and orchestration

- **Pipeline Layer**: Workflow management across development phases
