# Specification Handling

## Overview

Integrate enterprise guardrails (security, compliance, governance) and roadmap gates into plans; prevent "pilot purgatory" with scale-first design. This ensures that all development work is aligned with organizational requirements, regulatory standards, and production readiness requirements from the start.

## Requirements

Map compliance requirements to specific implementation tasks and tests:

- **SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley)**: Audit logging, access controls, change management

- **GDPR/CCPA**: Data privacy, consent management, right to be forgotten

- **HIPAA**: PHI protection, access logs, encryption requirements

- **PCI-DSS**: Card data handling, network segmentation, vulnerability management

- **ISO 27001**: Information security controls and policies

- Add audit logging requirements to relevant tasks

- Include compliance test cases in test plans

- Document evidence collection procedures

Include staged rollout plan with the following components:

- Canary deployment strategy (percentages, criteria)

- Blue/green deployment procedures

- Feature flag configuration and management

- Rollback triggers and procedures

- Disaster recovery and backup steps

- Monitoring and alerting thresholds

- Incident response procedures

Define post-launch feedback loops and training:

- User feedback collection mechanisms

- Analytics implementation for key metrics

- Internal training materials and sessions

- Documentation updates and distribution

- Feedback incorporation process

- Success criteria evaluation

Attach ROI and business outcomes to exit criteria:

- Quantifiable business KPIs

- Success metrics with baselines and targets

- Cost savings or revenue projections

- User adoption targets and measurement plan

- Technical debt assessment

- Long-term maintenance considerations

## 2. Rollout Plan

### Phase 1: Internal Alpha (Week 1)
- Deploy to staging environment
- Enable for internal QA team (10 users)
- Success criteria: No P0/P1 bugs, all unit tests pass
- Rollback trigger: Any P0 bug or >3 P1 bugs
- Rollback procedure: Deploy previous version, restore index from backup

### Phase 2: Employee Beta (Week 2)
- Deploy to production with feature flag
- Enable for 10% of employees (100 users)
- Success criteria: Search response time <300ms, relevance score >0.7
- Monitoring: Datadog dashboard with alerting on latency and errors
- Rollback trigger: >1% error rate or >500ms p95 latency
- Rollback procedure: Disable feature flag, log incident

### Phase 3: Controlled Rollout (Week 3)
- Ramp to 50% of users via feature flag
- A/B test against old search for relevance comparison
- Success criteria: 20% improvement in time-to-find metrics
- Rollback trigger: Negative feedback from >5% of users
- Rollback procedure: Revert to old search algorithm via flag

### Phase 4: Full Deployment (Week 4)
- Enable for 100% of users
- Deprecate old search endpoints (with 30-day grace period)
- Success criteria: All KPIs meeting targets
- Incident response: 24/7 on-call rotation with escalation path

### Disaster Recovery Plan
- Daily snapshot backups of search indexes
- Backup retention: 30 days of daily snapshots
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): 1 hour
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): 24 hours
- Backup validation: Weekly restore test to staging

## 3. Post-Launch Plan

### Feedback Collection
- Implement in-product feedback mechanism
- Add search quality rating (1-5 stars)
- Schedule user interviews (n=10) after 2 weeks
- Analyze search logs for unsuccessful searches

### Training & Documentation
| Audience | Materials | Timeline |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| End Users | Search tips documentation, 2-minute tutorial video | 1 week before launch |
| Support Team | Troubleshooting guide, common issues FAQ | 2 weeks before launch |
| Engineering | Architecture docs, code documentation, runbooks | Ongoing during development |
| New Employees | Add to onboarding materials | Post-launch |

### Continuous Improvement
- Bi-weekly review of search quality metrics
- Monthly relevance tuning based on feedback
- Quarterly index optimization review
- Semi-annual architecture review

## 4. Business Outcomes & Exit Criteria

### Key Performance Indicators
| KPI | Baseline | Target | Measurement Method |
|-----|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Time to find content | Avg 45 seconds | Avg 30 seconds | Analytics tracking from search to content view |
| Search success rate | 65% | 85% | Successful search = content view within 3 results |
| Search usage | 15% of sessions | 25% of sessions | Analytics on % of user sessions using search |
| Support tickets | 8% search-related | <3% search-related | Categorized support tickets |

### ROI Calculation
- Productivity savings: 15 seconds × 1,000 searches/day × 260 workdays × $50/hr = $54,166/year
- Reduced support burden: 5% reduction in tickets × 100 tickets/month × $15/ticket = $9,000/year
- Revenue impact: 2% conversion improvement × 10,000 monthly visitors × $100 avg order = $20,000/year
- Total annual benefit: $83,166
- Implementation cost: $75,000 (engineering time + infrastructure)
- ROI = 10.9% Year 1, 110.9% Year 2+

### ❌ Bad Example

```
# Search Implementation

## Security & Compliance
We'll make sure the search is secure and follows regulations.

## Rollout
We'll roll it out carefully to make sure it works.

## Training
We'll train users on how to use the search.

## Success Metrics
We'll track how well the search is working.
```

## Implementation Notes

- Create templates for compliance requirements by domain

- Maintain a library of reusable compliance test cases

- Integrate compliance verification into CI/CD pipeline

- Schedule regular compliance reviews and audits

- Document evidence collection procedures

- Conduct tabletop exercises for rollback and DR scenarios

- Create runbooks for common failure modes

- Implement automated compliance checking where possible

- Track compliance status in project dashboards
