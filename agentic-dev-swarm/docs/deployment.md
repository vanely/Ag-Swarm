# Deployment Guide

This guide covers the deployment process for the Agentic Software Development Swarm system.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying the system, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js 18+ installed

- Docker and Docker Compose

- Kafka and Zookeeper

- A vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, or similar)

- API keys for supported LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

## Installation

1. $1

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-dev-swarm.git
cd agentic-dev-swarm
```

1. $1

```
npm install
```

1. $1

```
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration details
```

1. $1

```
cp config/default.json config/local.json
# Edit local.json with your deployment-specific settings
```

## Deployment Options

### Local Development

For local development and testing:

```
npm run dev
```

This will start the system in development mode with hot reloading.

### Docker Deployment

For containerized deployment:

```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start all necessary services, including:

- The main swarm orchestration service

- Kafka and Zookeeper

- A vector database container (if configured)

- Monitoring and logging services

### Cloud Deployment

For production deployments in cloud environments:

Set up the required infrastructure:

- Kafka cluster (AWS MSK, Confluent Cloud, etc.)

- Vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)

- Container orchestration (Kubernetes, ECS, etc.)

1. $1

```
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

## Configuration

The system is configured using JSON files in the `config/` directory:

- `default.json`: Default configuration values

- `models.json`: LLM configuration and routing rules

- `project-template.json`: Template for new projects

### Sample Project Configuration

```
{
    "initial-specs": "Build a RESTful API for a blog system with user authentication",
    "frontend-stack": "React, Redux, Material UI",
    "backend-stack": "Node.js, Express, MongoDB",
    "deployment": {
        "platform": "AWS",
        "services": ["EC2", "S3", "RDS"]
    },
    "security-requirements": {
        "authentication": "JWT",
        "authorization": "RBAC"
    }
}
```

## Scaling

The system can scale horizontally by adding more instances of the orchestration service. The recommended scaling approach is:

1. $1

2. $1

3. $1

## Monitoring

The system provides monitoring endpoints that can be integrated with Prometheus and Grafana:

- `/metrics`: Prometheus-compatible metrics endpoint

- `/health`: System health check

- `/status`: Detailed system status and agent information

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

**Connection issues with Kafka**:

- Verify Kafka is running and accessible

- Check network connectivity and security groups

**LLM API errors**:

- Verify API keys are correctly configured

- Check rate limits and quotas

**Agent coordination failures**:

- Inspect the message queue for stuck messages

- Check the state manager for inconsistencies

**Performance issues**:

- Monitor resource utilization (CPU, memory, network)

- Scale components as needed

## Implementation Roadmap

For enterprise-grade deployment, follow this phased approach:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Security (Weeks 1-3)

- Infrastructure setup with security controls

- Governance framework implementation

- Team formation and training

- Pilot project selection

### Phase 2: Agent Development & Integration (Weeks 4-8)

- Core agent development

- Legacy system integration

- Communication protocol implementation

- Quality assurance testing

### Phase 3: Controlled Rollout (Weeks 9-12)

- Limited production deployment

- Performance optimization

- User training

- Feedback integration

### Phase 4: Scale & Optimize (Weeks 13-16)

- Enterprise-wide deployment

- Advanced capability deployment

- Process optimization

- ROI validation
